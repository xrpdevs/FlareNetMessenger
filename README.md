# Android-FLARE-Coston-Messenger

23/04/2021
Development has been halted for several weeks now due to Flare's Coston being down.
I'm considering running a private testnet myself to enable myself (and possibly others) to continue working with Coston.

I have noticed that people are cloning this project. If you like what you see and would like me to continue to develop this as
an open source project, please leave me some feedback, or start contributing.
